# Simplicial Homophily Beyond Triads

This repository contains data and code to replicate results in the paper

- Higher-order homophily on simplicial complexes. Arnab Sarker, Natalie Northrup, and Ali Jadbabaie. 2024.

This significantly extends results from our [previous work](https://github.com/arnabsarker/SimplicialHomophily) to study higher-order interactions beyond triads.

The code to replicate figures and tables in the main paper are available in [Analysis/](Analysis/). The higher-order homophily scores and results on higher-order link prediction are computed using the code in [Code/](Code/).
