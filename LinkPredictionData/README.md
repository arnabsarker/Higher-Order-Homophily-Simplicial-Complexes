This folder contains data for link prediction experiments in the paper

- Higher-order homophily on simplicial complexes. Arnab Sarker, Natalie Northrup, and Ali Jadbabaie. 2024.

Each dataset contains data similar to that in the folder [ScoreData/](../ScoreData) which is used to compute homophily scores on the training data.

Further, files of the form <code>simplices.txt</code>, <code>times.txt</code>, and <code>nverts.txt</code>, similar to that of [Benson et al.](https://github.com/arbenson/ScHoLP-Data/tree/master) are used for the link prediction experiments.
