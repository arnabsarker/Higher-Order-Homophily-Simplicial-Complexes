Each dataset contains a file <code>labels.csv</code> which indicates each node's associated metadata (group label), files of the form <code>size-{k}-unique-sorted.csv</code> which contain observed relationships between groups of size <code>k</code>, and files of the form <code>skeleton-size-{k}.csv</code> which contain all sets of <code>k</code> nodes for which all underlying <code>k-1</code> size relationships occur.

Processed data from the <code>soc-</code> data from large social networks are excluded in this repository due to their size. Please reach out to corresponding author for access to these data. The original sources of all data are also cited in the main text and SI Appendix of the paper.
